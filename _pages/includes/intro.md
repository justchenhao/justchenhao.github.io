# ðŸ‘‹ About Me
I am a Researcher at [Shanghai AI Laboratory](https://www.shlab.org.cn/), working with Prof. [Wanli Ouyang](https://wlouyang.github.io/) and [Lei Bai](http://leibai.site/). Before that, I got my Ph.D. from Beihang University under the supervision of Prof. Shi Zhenwei, the head of [LEVIR Laboratory](https://levir.buaa.edu.cn/).

My research interests lie in large-scale earth system understanding and prediction, focusing on developing efficient and robust deep learning algorithms by leveraging multi-source earth data (e.g., observations, simulations, analysis) to estimate and predict the status of our Earth system (Atmosphere, Environment, Land). The related tasks include weather forecasting, multi-source data fusion, and remote sensing image understanding.

If you are interested in the research intern or [Joint Training Ph.D. Project](https://www.shlab.org.cn/enrollment) at Shanghai AI Lab, feel free to drop me an [email](mailto:chenhao1@pjlab.org.cn). Students with good foundations in AI-based spatiotemporal data fusion, Earth system forecasting, or quantitative remote sensing are appreciated.
