# ðŸ‘‹ About Me
I am a Junior Researcher at [Shanghai AI Laboratory](https://www.shlab.org.cn/), working with Prof. [Wanli Ouyang](https://wlouyang.github.io/) and [Lei Bai](http://leibai.site/). Prior to that, I got my Ph.D. from Beihang University under the supervision of Prof. Shi Zhenwei, the head of [LEVIR Laboratory](https://levir.buaa.edu.cn/).

My research interests lie in AI4Earth, remote sensing image processing, large-scale pretraining, and multimodal learning. I am currently working on Earth System Science by leveraging large-scale Earth observation data.

If you are interested in research intern at Shanghai AI Lab, feel free to drop me an email. Students with good foundations in quantitative remote sensing or programming are appreciated.
